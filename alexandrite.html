		 <h4> This stone’s discovery makes a fascinating story. It is said that miners were working in the mountains one day and collecting emeralds. A miner gathered some emeralds and brought them back to their camp after a day’s work. However, when he brought out the emeralds and put them by the light of the campfire, they shone a lovely shade of red! This perplexed the miners, especially the next morning when they saw that the emeralds were colour green again. It was then that they realized they have stumbled upon something new, unique, valuable, and mysterious. But it was only in 1839 when the stones were identified and given the name Alexandrite. Because the stone showed green and red colours, which happened to be the Old Imperial Russia’s military colours, it became the national stone of Russia.</h4>
